# Refutations of Conventional Wisdom

[← Back to Index](README.md)

In contemporary mathematics, ideas are supposedly not accepted absent rigorous
proof. Historically, some statements that were generally accepted were then
shown to be false.

## 1. Irrationality of certain numbers

The Pythagoreans believed that all numbers can be expressed as a ratio of two
whole numbers. This was disproved by one of Pythagoras' own disciples,
**Hippasus**, who showed that the square root of two is what we today call an
irrational number. One story claims that he was thrown off the ship in which he
and some other Pythagoreans were sailing because his discovery was too heretical.

## 2. The parallel postulate

**Euclid's** parallel postulate stated that if two lines cross a third in a
plane in such a way that the sum of the "interior angles" is not 180° then the
two lines meet. Furthermore, he implicitly assumed that two separate
intersecting lines meet at only one point. These assumptions were believed to be
true for more than 2000 years, but in light of General Relativity at least the
second can no longer be considered true. In fact the very notion of a straight
line in four-dimensional curved space-time has to be redefined, which one can do
as a geodesic. It is now recognized that Euclidean geometry can be studied as a
mathematical abstraction, but that the universe is non-Euclidean.

## 3. Fermat numbers

**Fermat** conjectured that all numbers of the form 2^(2^m) + 1 (known as
Fermat numbers) were prime. However, this conjecture was disproved by **Euler**,
who found that:

> 2^(2^5) + 1 = 4,294,967,297 = 641 × 6,700,417

## 4. Transcendental numbers are unusual

The idea that transcendental numbers were unusual was disproved by **Georg
Cantor**, who showed that there are so many transcendental numbers that it is
impossible to make a one-to-one mapping between them and the algebraic numbers.
In other words, the cardinality of the set of transcendentals is greater than
that of the set of algebraic numbers.

## 5. The logarithmic integral overestimates the prime-counting function

**Bernhard Riemann**, at the end of his famous 1859 paper "On the Number of
Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude", stated (based on his results) that the
logarithmic integral gives a somewhat too high estimate of the prime-counting
function. The evidence also seemed to indicate this. However, in 1914 **J. E.
Littlewood** proved that this was not always the case, and in fact it is now
known that the first x for which π(x) > li(x) occurs somewhere before 10^317.
See Skewes' number for more detail.

## 6. Continuous functions must "usually" be differentiable

Naively it might be expected that a continuous function must have a derivative or
else that the set of points where it is not differentiable should be "small" in
some sense. This was disproved in 1872 by **Karl Weierstrass**, and in fact
examples had been found earlier of functions that were nowhere differentiable
(see Weierstrass function). According to Weierstrass in his paper, earlier
mathematicians including Gauss had often assumed that such functions did not
exist.

## 7. Most numbers have an odd number of prime factors

It was conjectured in 1919 by **George Pólya**, based on the evidence, that most
numbers less than any particular limit have an odd number of prime factors.
However, this Pólya conjecture was disproved in 1958. It turns out that for some
values of the limit (such as values a bit more than 906 million), most numbers
less than the limit have an even number of prime factors.
