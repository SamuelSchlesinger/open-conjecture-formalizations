# Open Conjecture Formalizations

Lean 4 formalizations of open mathematical conjectures, alongside a curated
index of notable conjectures transcribed from
[Wikipedia's List of Conjectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_conjectures).

## Formalizations

Each conjecture formalization lives in its own repository, included here as a
git submodule. To clone everything:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:SamuelSchlesinger/open-conjecture-formalizations.git
```
